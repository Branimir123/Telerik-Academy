#Intro to SQL

###What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

- ***SQL*** is a standard language for accessing databases.
- A ***data manipulation language (DML)*** is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also considered a component of DML.

    A popular data manipulation language is that of Structured Query Language (SQL), which is used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database.[1] Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DLI, CODASYL databases, such as IDMS and others.

- A ***data definition*** language or data description language ***(DDL)*** is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas.

- Most important commands in ***SQL***:
    - SELECT - extracts data from a database
    - UPDATE - updates data in a database
    - DELETE - deletes data from a database
    - INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    - CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    - ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    - CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    - ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    - DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    - CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    - DROP INDEX - deletes an index

###What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?
- Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases.

- T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.

- Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
